    <p>Flavorful smashed burgers </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
       <li> 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
       <li>16 to 20 ounces (455g to 570g) ground beef, divided into four 4-ounce portions (see note)</li>
       <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
       <li>Cheese slices (if desired)</li>
       <li>Four toasted burger buns</li>
       <li>Toppings and condiments, as desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a 12-inch stainless steel, carbon steel, or cast iron skillet and wipe around with a paper towel. Set skillet over medium heat and allow to preheat for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, gently form each portion of ground beef into a cylindrical puck about 2 inches tall, pressing together just until meat holds its shape without falling apart. Season generously on all sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Increase heat under skillet to high and heat until skillet is smoking. Add 2 beef pucks to skillet and, using a firm, stiff metal spatula, press down on each one until they're roughly 4 to 4 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. It helps to use a second spatula to apply downward pressure to the first if you are having trouble smashing them hard enough.</li>
        <li>Cook without moving until a golden brown crust develops, about 1 1/2 minutes. Use the edge of the spatula to carefully scrape up and flip the patties one at a time, making sure to get all browned bits removed from the skillet. If using cheese, add now.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook until patties are cooked to desired donenessâ€”about 30 seconds longer for medium-rare. Transfer patties to toasted buns, topping buns and/or patties as desired, close burgers, and serve immediately. Wipe out skillet with paper towel and repeat process with remaining ground beef pucks.</li>
