    <h2>Description</h2>
     
    <p>Spicy but balanced condiment</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>  2 (15-ounce) cans fire roasted tomatoes or use 4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes (1 3/4 pounds)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped white or sweet onion (half medium onion)</li>
        <li> 2 medium cloves garlic (2 teaspoons minced)</li>
        <li>1 to 2 medium jalape√±o or serrano peppers, with stems, membrane and seeds removed
        </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 to 2 medium limes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste</li>    
      




    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>

        
        <li>Place tomatoes into a colander set over a large bowl and allow to drain. Save drained juice to add back to salsa if it is too thick or save to add to soups or other dishes.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onion to a medium bowl and cover with cold water. Set aside for 10 minutes, drain, and then rinse.</li>
        <li>Add garlic to a blender or bowl of a food processor and pulse until chopped small. Scrape the sides, and then add the drained tomatoes, drained and rinsed onions, peppers, cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and the juice of half a lime. Pulse until your desired texture. Taste, and then season with additional salt or lime juice. (We typically add 3/4 teaspoon of salt).</li>
        <li>This salsa improves with time so if you have the option, set it aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or more before serving. Store in the refrigerator up to a week.</li>
